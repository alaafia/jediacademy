# 🛠️ The Code Awakens: Jedi Academy Training System 🛠️

**Welcome, young Padawan, to the Jedi Academy!** 🌟  
This project is part of an epic journey through the galaxy to master the art of bug-free Java code. It’s not just a codebase—it's a training ground for Jedi developers!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a system used by the Jedi Council to manage and track Jedi training missions across the galaxy. It was created as part of a live demo during my Java Developer Day talk, where we explored advanced Java techniques using a fun, Star Wars-inspired theme.

## 🔥 Features

- **Jedi & Missions**: Manage Jedi trainees and their missions with ease.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Handle specific scenarios with clarity and precision, just like a Jedi wielding a lightsaber.
- **Defensive Programming**: Protect the galaxy (and your code) from unexpected errors.
- **Structured Logging**: Monitor your system’s behavior as if you had the Force guiding you.
- **Advanced Debugging**: Hunt down bugs like a true Jedi Master.

## 📚 Sections Covered

1. **Understanding Java Errors and Exceptions** on Tatooine 🌵
2. **Creating Custom Exceptions** in the lush fields of Naboo 🌿
3. **Implementing Defensive Programming** at the galactic center, Coruscant 🏙️
4. **Structured Logging** on the volatile planet Mustafar 🌋
5. **Advanced Debugging** in the dense forests of Endor 🌲

## 🧰 Tools & Setup

- **Java 21**
- **IntelliJ IDEA (2024)**
- **Maven/Gradle**
- **SLF4J & Logback**
- **JUnit 5 & Mockito**
- **JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) & VisualVM**

## 🗺️ Journey Ahead

Clone the repo, and may the Force be with you as you explore the galaxy of advanced Java programming. This project is designed to evolve, so feel free to expand upon it as you grow in your Jedi developer skills!

## 👩‍💻 About

This project was created as part of a live coding demo during my talk at Java Developer Day 2024. The code here is meant to showcase best practices in error handling, logging, and debugging, all while having a bit of fun. Enjoy, and happy coding!
